name: evidence-research-question
description: Turn a vague topic into a precise, searchable research question using
  frameworks such as PICO, PEO, SPIDER and PCC, with key concepts, synonyms and inclusion
  criteria. Use at the start of any evidence search.

## Unified plugin integration

Read [the integration contract](../../docs/INTEGRATION.md) when combining workflows. This active copy retains the complete source instructions below with namespaced skill references. Original bytes and upstream metadata remain in `../../resources/`. Resolve tools by their actual host capabilities; tool names in upstream instructions are capability requirements, not proof of connection. Use the task workspace for generated outputs. Treat historical case-study results as supplied examples, not newly verified findings.

# Research Question


## Purpose
A sharp question finds better evidence in less time. Most weak searches start with a vague question.

## Frameworks
| Framework | Parts | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| PICO | Population, Intervention or exposure, Comparison, Outcome | Effects: "Does X change Y?" |
| PEO | Population, Exposure, Outcome | Associations and observational questions |
| SPIDER | Sample, Phenomenon of interest, Design, Evaluation, Research type | Qualitative experiences |
| PCC | Population, Concept, Context | Scoping reviews and broad mapping |

## Steps
1. Restate the user's topic as one clear question.
2. Break it into framework parts.
3. List 3 to 6 synonyms and related terms for each key concept (these feed search-strings).
4. Suggest inclusion limits: years, languages, study types, regions, population.
5. Offer a narrower and a broader version of the question.

## Example
Topic: "remote work and productivity"
Question: "Among office employees, does full-time remote work, compared with office work, change measured productivity?"
Concepts: remote work (telework, work from home, telecommuting, hybrid work); productivity (performance, output, efficiency).

## Output format
The final question, a framework table, the concept and synonym list, and suggested limits.
